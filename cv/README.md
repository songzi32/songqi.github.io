# Dr. Spencer Bryngelson's academic CV

This is the XeLaTeX source for my CV.
It is primarily here so that I can keep track of it via a centralized location on the WWW.
It modifies a CV class (located in resume.cls) that I found years ago.
As far as academic CVs go, the source stands to be improved tremendously. 
In particular, I would like to make it compatible with .bib files, though my specific requriements have prevented me from doing this just yet.
